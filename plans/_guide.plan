Modified version of carmacks plan files.

* means it was completed
  means it was not completed
- means it was decided against

Often I will just copy the plan from the previous day and delete all the lines prefixed with *.
Often start the work session by listing off todos in the plan file. 
Not used religiously, there are things missing.

currently unused symbols:
/ 
+
^
&
